        <div class="body white">
        <p>What's this spatial audio you've been hearing more and more about lately? Apple Spatial and Dolby Atmos take what we know of as surround sound, and expand it to a spherical dimension. They place the listener in the middle of the sound.

It doesn't require large, fancy listening environments and can be achieved through ear pods and headphones. It's brilliant, and an effective way to get your music into some new, popular playlists. We can help you do it!</p>
