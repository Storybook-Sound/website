        <p>Where surround technology places the listener in 360&deg; space, Apple Spatial and Dolby Atmos expand to a spherical dimension.</p>
        <p>This effect doesn't require large, fancy listening environments and can be achieved through ear pods and headphones.</p>
        <p>Sonic elements are finely tuned to mimic the way the ear delivers "directional" details to the brain.</p>
        <p>It's brilliant, and an effective way to get your music into some new, popular playlists.</p>
