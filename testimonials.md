<blockquote>"Scott Anthony has a great sounding studio and a fantastic set of ears to go with it. Scott mixed and mastered 20 tracks that had been recorded on 1" 8 track tape, in and around 1974/75, by David Gilmour in his home studio. I was producing in Shalford, Surrey, UK and Scott mixed and mastered at his Storybook Sound Studios in New Jersey. USA. Scott became like a member of the band and worked wonders on those tracks which became the Omnivore Recordings album release ' Laughing Up Your Sleeve' by Unicorn."

<blockquote>"Storybook is so aptly named. The space is unlike any you'll see, out of a musician's fairy tale. Scott casts a spell over everything that passes through his soundboard, giving it sparkle and magic. Even if you send him your files and never get a chance to see the place. I once sent him a pile of cassettes, mp3s and DAT tapes from a band I produced long ago in the hopes he could make it into the album we wanted. He did. It was a miracle. I've recorded there, mixed there, mastered there. Great experience, great results."

<blockquote>"Storybook Sound is my number one go to studio!  I've worked there more times than I can count for both mastering and recording.  For brand new projects or restoring and remastering vintage tapes  the knowledge, art and sensitivity to detail Scott  brings to his work is awe inspiring and reassuring.  I know the job will be done right and come out better than I could have imagined!"

I am not a technical person, but when I get my mastered songs back from Scott and he's worked his magic, my songs sound exactly as I had hoped they would. Scott is so kind and easy to work with. He'll help you realize the full potential of your songs. Do yourself a big favor and make Storybook Sound your go-to studio for mastering!"
