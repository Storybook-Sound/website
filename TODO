Handle "track" items from BC when image duplicate of the "album" image
[like this one](https://emilyduff.bandcamp.com/track/the-remedy)
Also the Artist and Album end up getting mixed up here.
DIG:

```html
<div id="name-section">
    <h2 class="trackTitle">
        The Remedy
    </h2>
    <h3 class="albumTitle">

```yaml
- project: 'The Remedy'
  artist: 'Go Tell Your Friends'
  year: 2015
  roles:
    - Mastering
  project_url:
    url: 'https://emilyduff.bandcamp.com/track/the-remedy'

    title: 'Go Tell Your Friends "The Remedy"'
```

Also are we missing project urls for a bunch of the imported ones:

```yaml

- project: 'Do The Needful'
  artist: 'Evergreen'
  year: 2018
  roles:
    - Mastering
  notes: >-

  image:
    url: images/discography/2018/a1957058005_10.jpg
    title: 'Evergreen "Do The Needful"'
```
Perhaps these were ones we had added manually. May need to be checking for presence of project by project name and artist name.
