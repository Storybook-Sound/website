- A <a href="https://tapeop.com" target="_blank">TapeOp</a> article by Scott and Rebecca: <a href="https://tapeop.com/interviews/138/david-gilmour/" target="_blank">David Gilmour: The Artist as Producer: Unicorn and Kate Bush</a>.

- An interview with Scott by Nugen Audio about using their surround mixing tools for a Richard Thompson documentary.

- Omniana is a homestream, fundraiser variety show produced at Storybook, featuring many of our dear, talented friends.

- Infinite Glitch – The World’s Longest Pop Song. The original Major Glitch was mixed in 1996 by Scott with Chris Butler, and then featured in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Infinite Glitch is the Major Glitch re-homed from a finite compact disc to the wide-open internet. Musical contributions from Scott are here (recorded and performed 100% by virtual instruments and voices), and here (a re-imagining of Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt’s Oblique Strategies as 19 minutes of verses).

- Scott spent much of 2020 designing public art. Thank you, George Harrison.
