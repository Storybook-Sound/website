<h2>Wall of Instant Fame</h2>
<blockquote>Scott took instant photos of almost every visitor to the studio during our first year. While more and more folks send projects to us via the internet, we wanted to show how much we actually do love it when guests stop by. He did forget to pull the camera out a few times, and this instant snapshot project did continue past the first year, right up until we ran outta film in early 2020.<cite>â€“Rebecca Turner</cite></blockquote>
