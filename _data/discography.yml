    "SCOTT ANTHONY (The Shitbirds, Nu-Sonics, Fond Farewells, Rebecca Turner) - When Scott’s not busy being amazing, he spends his off-hours being awesome. He converted his basement into a world-class mixing and mastering studio (www.storybooksound.com) and artists far and wide have called on his considerable skills for years now. It’s one of my favorite rooms ever and I got to spend a lot of time there watching Scott work his magic. He is an expert at his craft, mad fun to hang with, and I could not be more honored or excited that this record wound up in his capable hands for mixing and mastering. We go back a long way. He is a delightful human being and I am so thankful to have worked with him once again. Scott turned me on to the famous Sloppy Joe’s served at the Town Hall Deli in South Orange, NJ. I’m a few pounds heavier now, but forever grateful. Hashtag YUM! He also teaches yoga classes because it’s just so him." -- Jim Higgins
