  notes: "Unfortunately, the turret is all  one open space and you can't climb up and look out that window.  But it's still pretty cool and makes it easy to find the house. Having said that, please come around the back where it will be easier to park and haul your equipment in!"

  caption: "Our beloved laboratory."
  notes: "Pretty tidy, right? We guarantee you it doesn't look like that right now. For one thing, all along the sides is our collection of music books, large and small, that you can thumb through at your leisure! Plus Rebecca's dad's collection of vintage opera libretti if you're into that!"

  caption: "The lab is loungy."
  notes: "This is our fab sofa from Of Iron and Oak in Lambertville, NJ! It's very cozy and many have dozed up on it. Above is a custom acoustic panel by the brilliant Wylie Wirth, that opens to a window into our live room."

  caption: "That's the window to our little live room, which fits up to 4-5."
  notes: "This is a great little live/ISO/rehearsal room, and the beautiful acoustic panel opens up so you can see inside. When  we have folks recording in the main room or in the bar area too, we rig up  monitors so everyone can see each other."

  caption: "Sometimes we record bands."
  notes: "Mastering is our bread and butter but we also have recorded a lot of great stuff here, like The Campfire Flies, Juniper Shelley, the Eugene Chrysler Band, the Bedsit Poets, and more. The studio overall has a wonderful warm sound and we're happy to accommodate any setup."

  caption: "There's even a bar."
  notes: "Like many prohibition-era homes in our neighborhood, ours has a bar in our basement. It used to be covered with 80s faux-wood paneling until Juniper Shelley noticed a hole through which she could see words. The poetry we found underneath is by Piet Hein, a WWII-era anti-fascist Dutch poet. A Dutch doctor who admired him used to live here and painted these poems on the bar!"

  caption: "There's even a bar."
  notes: "Most sessions end with a celebratory drink or a toast of some sort! People bring us stuff. We buy stuff. And we even still have some sake and vermouth from the 80s, that belonged to Rebecca's dad."

  notes: "Take a seat on our old church pew, do some work (ugh) on your laptop at the desk, or put up your feet on Rebecca's mom's old chaise. George Harrison door artwork by the astounding Liza Zwier.  Warning: When you get here this area may be completely rearranged and set up for some kind of guitar tracking or ukelele livestream."

  notes: "We've even done tracking in our living room, which has a crazy high wooden ceiling, a pretty fireplace, and a great sound."

  notes: "Our town archives had this picture of our house back in the day. Those azalea bushes and that rhododendron are still there!"
